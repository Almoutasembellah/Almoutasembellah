-this is a simple neural network model to classify human cloths 
-we have in this data sets 10 classes of human cloths ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 
               'Sandal',      'Shirt',   'Sneaker',  'Bag',   'Ankle boot']
- the mession of our model here to recognize the picture  and say which class of clothes this picture belong by using probability
-brows it it is very simple and usful model 
- TO use this notebook you need to install 
    -ensorFlow 2.0 or newer, 
    -TensorFlow Datasets 
    -TensorFlow Hub. 
The easiest way to install TensorFlow 2.0, TensorFlow Datasets, and TensorFlow Hub is via 
You'll also need to install NumPy and Jupyter notebooks, the newest versions of these should work fine. 
Using the conda package manager is generally best for this,

conda install numpy jupyter notebook
